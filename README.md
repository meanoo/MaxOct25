I created this piece drawing inspiration from, yet again, Artiom Constantinov. In particular, his audio reactive piece linked above. I just love his pairing
of monochrome and sheer intricacy. It simplifies the burst of an image to allow fo the eye to capture the complex nature of the graphic. The inverting and instant
glitch-like switching between graphics also drew me in. The sound however, was repetitive yet growing. Phasing as the graphics reveal themselves. 

I structured my audio beap recipe similarly. Repeating sounds the change in tone and distortion. These I feel are parameters more easily conveyable through 
visuals than most other audible sounds. Another good one being tying speed or brightness with drum kicks or bass.
